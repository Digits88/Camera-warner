# Camera-warner

This app's aim is to warn you if you get too near a cctv.

You can set the radius in which you will be notified in the settings as well as the Source for the camera's to use (thought there's only 1 available currently). The app will show a map with all camera's near you when you open it. The cctv markers are clustered to improve the performance. They will be replaced by a heatmap in the future.
